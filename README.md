# Genetic Profile and Genotype-Phenotype correlation of Children with Primary Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis


### Hypothesis/Research question
- To determine the genetic yield of clinical exome sequencing for diagnosis of dRTA. <br  >
- To correlate the genetic variants with the phenotypic characteristics of dRTA. <br  >

### Findings

- Exome sequencing established a genetic diagnosis of dRTA in more than half of the cohort with a change in diagnosis in 3 children.  <br  >  

- Our data showed some genotype-specific characteristics in children with distal RTA specially with respect to growth retardation, SNHL and severity of hypokalemia.  <br  >  


### Samples
Total Number of Patients Screened: **60** <br>  
Total Number of Patients Samples sequenced: **48** <br>  
 
### Data
    
- Patients and Clinical data: <br>
Children with clinical diagnosis with dRTA (age group: newborn -18 years). Clinical data, Biochemical and pedigree information. <br>   

### Study methodology

### Data analysis

- secondary analysis <br>  

Mapping with BWA and variant calling using GATK4 <br>  

- tertiary analysis <br>

- genotype phenotype correlation analysis <br>  

Student's t-test for pairwise comparisons. <br>  
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for group comparisons. <br>  
R packages: `rstatix`, `ggplot2` <br>
